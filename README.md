Evaluation

- Navigation: I have successfully implemented and designed a navigation bar that will be consistent throughout my website. It is also responsive as depending on the size of the view port its dimensions change to give it a consistent look.

- Layout: My overall layout remains consistent with text sizes and headers being consistent throughout the site. It is also responsive as they adjust base on the size of the view port

- Colour Choices: For colour choice I chose a scheme that intertwines with the overall aesthetic of the city and use hex codes so I can get the particular colours I want so the navigation bar, background etc.. is consistent with the icons I have designed

- Challenges faced: The main challenge I faced was getting the static map to display at first I just took a screen shot of the location I wanted as a place holder for the map but once I implemented the actual static map from openstreetmap it struggled to get it load properly as it was displaying a world map as apposed to the small location of Edinburgh. I realized I was't loading an api so the map didn't know what to display.
